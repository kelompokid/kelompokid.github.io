                                            I have a very special pet. It is a very cute cat. My dad gave it to me for my birthday. When my dad gave it to me, it was three months old. I name it Ruli.
Ruli is very beautiful. It has white fluffy fur and green eyes. It has a little grey spot in its head and a black stripes on its tail with soft fur. It has four small legs with very cute paws. It eats salty fish. It often sleeps on a couch in the living room.
Ruli is a very smart cat. It knows my daily schedule every day. It wakes me up in the morning a couple of minutes before my alarm clock sounds off by jumping into my bed. It even knows what time I come home. It mews really hard and scratches the door. I’m always happy to see it after school. I’m happy because I know it is waiting for me. It also knows what time I go to bed. Ruli is really cute and smart.
Why does the writer think that the cat is smart?
A. It often sleeps on a couch in the living room
B. It doesn’t know my daily schedule every day
C. It mews really hard and scratches the door
D. It wakes me up in the morning before my alarm is off</a>

                            7. I have a very special pet. It is a very cute cat. My dad gave it to me for my birthday. When my dad gave it to me, it was three months old. I name it Ruli.
Ruli is very beautiful. It has white fluffy fur and green eyes. It has a little grey spot in its head and a black stripes on its tail with soft fur. It has four small legs with very cute paws. It eats salty fish. It often sleeps on a couch in the living room.
Ruli is a very smart cat. It knows my daily schedule every day. It wakes me up in the morning a couple of minutes before my alarm clock sounds off by jumping into my bed. It even knows what time I come home. It mews really hard and scratches the door. I’m always happy to see it after school. I’m happy because I know it is waiting for me. It also knows what time I go to bed. Ruli is really cute and smart.
Why does the writer think that the cat is smart?
A. It often sleeps on a couch in the living room
B. It doesn’t know my daily schedule every day
C. It mews really hard and scratches the door
D. It wakes me up in the morning before my alarm is off</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Imagine that you are seven years old. You are participating in an experiment. A
</p><p>researcher greets you and shows you into a small room. In the room there is a
</p><p>marshmallow. The marshmallow is for you, but here is the interesting part: The
</p><p>researcher tells you that he is going to leave you alone in the room for a while. You can
</p><p>eat the marshmallow right away, or you can wait until he gets back. If you wait until he
</p><p>gets back, you will get a second marshmallow.
</p><p>What do you do? Do you eat the marshmallow right away?
</p><p>An experiment like this, known informally as the marshmallow experiment, was
</p><p>conducted decades ago at Stanford University. It turned out that some children ate the
</p><p>marshmallow right away, while others were able to wait. In other words, some sought
</p><p>instant self-gratification, and some delayed it.
</p><p>Years later, the researchers followed up on the participants. They found that the
</p><p>children who delayed self-gratification were in general more successful than those who
</p><p>ate the marshmallow right away. By a variety of measures, including SAT scores, they
</p><p>appeared to be more competent.
</p><p>Common sense tells us that the ability to delay self-gratification is a mark of maturity.
</p><p>The marshmallow experiment provides evidence that it may also correlate with success in life</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p></p><br />
