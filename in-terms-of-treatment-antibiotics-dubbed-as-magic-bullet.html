                                            Antibiotic is kind of compounds both natural and synthetic, which has function to press or stop a process of organism’s growth, particularly bacteria. Antibiotic is used to treat bacterial infections and used as a tool for genetic engineering in biotechnology. Antibiotic works as pesticides by pressing or break the chain of bacteria’s metabolism. Nevertheless, antibiotic is different with disinfectant in the process to kills bacteria. Disinfectant kills bacteria by creating an unnatural environment for germs to live.
In terms of treatment, antibiotics dubbed as “magic bullet “because antibiotic kills instantly without injuring its sufferers. Although antibiotic is good for medication, it is not effective in handling infection caused by viruses, fungi, or other nonbacterial.
Antibiotic has diverse types based on their effectiveness against bacteria. There are antibiotics that target gram- negative or gram- positive bacteria and some antibiotic has wider spectrum. The effectiveness depends on location of the infection and the ability of antibiotic to reach location of the infection. Based on how to use, antibiotics are divided into two that are oral antibiotics and antibiotic intradermal. An oral antibiotic is used by mouth while antibiotic intradermal used through anus. Intradermal antibiotic is used for serious cases.

An antibiotic is compounds that is used to stop the growing process of certain organism, to be precise, bacteria. In biotechnology, an antibiotic is used as a tool to treat bacterial infection. It works by breaking the metabolism of bacteria’s chain. In the process of killing bacteria, antibiotic is not the same as disinfectant because disinfectant kills bacteria by making a peculiar environment of germs to live in.
Because the antibiotic kills the bacteria quickly, without harming the sufferer, it is known as “magic bullet”. Even though antibiotics are known as good medication, they are not suggested for use in treating infection caused by other nonbacterial, such as fungi and viruses. 
There are several types of antibiotics, based in how effective they are in treating bacteria. The antibiotics are divided into two types based in how they are used, which are oral antibiotics and antibiotic intradermal. An oral antibiotic is used by the sufferers through the mouth, while the antibiotic intradermal is used through the anus usually for serious cases.

                            16. Antibiotic is kind of compounds both natural and synthetic, which has function to press or stop a process of organism’s growth, particularly bacteria. Antibiotic is used to treat bacterial infections and used as a tool for genetic engineering in biotechnology. Antibiotic works as pesticides by pressing or break the chain of bacteria’s metabolism. Nevertheless, antibiotic is different with disinfectant in the process to kills bacteria. Disinfectant kills bacteria by creating an unnatural environment for germs to live.
In terms of treatment, antibiotics dubbed as “magic bullet “because antibiotic kills instantly without injuring its sufferers. Although antibiotic is good for medication, it is not effective in handling infection caused by viruses, fungi, or other nonbacterial.
Antibiotic has diverse types based on their effectiveness against bacteria. There are antibiotics that target gram- negative or gram- positive bacteria and some antibiotic has wider spectrum. The effectiveness depends on location of the infection and the ability of antibiotic to reach location of the infection. Based on how to use, antibiotics are divided into two that are oral antibiotics and antibiotic intradermal. An oral antibiotic is used by mouth while antibiotic intradermal used through anus. Intradermal antibiotic is used for serious cases.

An antibiotic is compounds that is used to stop the growing process of certain organism, to be precise, bacteria. In biotechnology, an antibiotic is used as a tool to treat bacterial infection. It works by breaking the metabolism of bacteria’s chain. In the process of killing bacteria, antibiotic is not the same as disinfectant because disinfectant kills bacteria by making a peculiar environment of germs to live in.
Because the antibiotic kills the bacteria quickly, without harming the sufferer, it is known as “magic bullet”. Even though antibiotics are known as good medication, they are not suggested for use in treating infection caused by other nonbacterial, such as fungi and viruses. 
There are several types of antibiotics, based in how effective they are in treating bacteria. The antibiotics are divided into two types based in how they are used, which are oral antibiotics and antibiotic intradermal. An oral antibiotic is used by the sufferers through the mouth, while the antibiotic intradermal is used through the anus usually for serious cases.
