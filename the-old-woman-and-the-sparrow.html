                                                the old woman and    the sparrow
    once upon a time, there lived a kind hearted man and his wife . one morning,his wife found a poor little sparrow. she took it gently and fed it. to show its gratitude, the sparrow stayed with them and sang every morning. but there was an ill-tempered old woman who didn't like the sparrow. she cut the sparrow tongue. that's why the bird flew away to his previous nest.
    knowing that their sparrow flew away,the kind man and woman looked for their sparrow. they walked a long way,crossed the bridge,climbed a mountain and passed the wood.
   not long afterwards,they could find the sparrow's nest. the sparrow welcomed them and provided a feast for them. before they went home,the sparrow brought two baskets,one was large and looked heavy, and the other one was small and light. the sparrow asked them to choose one.
   they chosen the small one and that's the best choice . there were many rolls of silk and pile of gold in it.
   being jealous,the ill-tempered old woman did the same thing as the kind man and woman did. she closed the big basket,which actually contained wasps and venomous crawlers such as scorpions,centipedes,and other horrible creatures. finally,the stung and bit her to death.

The Old Woman and The Sparrow
Once upon a time, there lived a kind hearted man and his wife. One morning, his wife found a poor little sparrow. She took it gently and fed it. To show its gratitude, the sparrow stayed with them and sang every morning. But there was an ill-tempered old woman who didn't like the sparrow. She cut the sparrow's tongue. That's why the bird flew away to its previous nest.
Knowing that their sparrow flew away, the kind man and his wife looked for the sparrow. They walked a long way, crossed the bridges, climbed the mountains and passed the woods.
At last, they could find the sparrow's nest. The sparrow welcomed them and provided a feast for them. Before they went home, the sparrow brought two baskets; one was large and looked heavy, and the other one was small and light. The sparrow asked them to choose only one. They chose the small and that was the best choice. There were many rolls of silk and piles of gold in it.
Being jealous, the ill-tempered old woman did the same thing as the kind man and his wife did. She chose the big basket which actually contained wasps and venomous crawlers, such as scorpions, centipedes, and other horrible creatures. Finally, aaathey stung and bit her to death. </a>

                        The Old Woman and The Sparrow<br />Once upon a time, there lived a kind hearted man and his wife. One morning, his wife found a poor little sparrow. She took it gently and fed it. To show its gratitude, the sparrow stayed with them and sang every morning. But there was an ill-tempered old woman who didn't like the sparrow. She cut the sparrow's tongue. That's why the bird flew away to its previous nest.<br />Knowing that their sparrow flew away, the kind man and his wife looked for the sparrow. They walked a long way, crossed the bridges, climbed the mountains and passed the woods.<br />At last, they could find the sparrow's nest. The sparrow welcomed them and provided a feast for them. Before they went home, the sparrow brought two baskets; one was large and looked heavy, and the other one was small and light. The sparrow asked them to choose only one. They chose the small and that was the best choice. There were many rolls of silk and piles of gold in it.<br /><br />Being jealous, the ill-tempered old woman did the same thing as the kind man and his wife did. She chose the big basket which actually contained wasps and venomous crawlers, such as scorpions, centipedes, and other horrible creatures. Finally, aaathey stung and bit her to death.<br /><br />semoga membantu, tandai jawaban terbaik ya ka:) sekian<br />

                        Aku ada sih ceritanya di buku LKS,ini translatenya kalo dari buku LKS ku :<br />"Wanita tua dan burung Gereja"<br />Pada suatu hari,hiduplah seorang pria dan istrinya yang baik hati. Suatu pagi,istrinya menemukan burung Gereja kecil yang malang. Ia membawanya dengan lemah-lembut dan merawatnya. Untuk menunjukkan rasa terimakasihnya,burung Gereja tinggal bersama mereka dan bernyanyi setiap pagi. Tapi ada seorang wanita tua pemarah yang tidak menyukai burung Gereja itu. Ia memotong lidah burung Gereja. Itulah alasan mengapa burung itu terbang jauh kembali ke sarangnya yang sebelumnya.<br />Ketika mengetahui bahwa burung Gereja terbang jauh,pria dan wanita baik tersebut mencari burung Gereja itu. Mereka melewati perjalanan yang panjang,menyebrangi jembatan,mendaki gunung dan melewati hutan.<br />Tidak lama setelah itu,mereka dapat menemukan sarang burung Gereja. Burung Gereja menyambut mereka dan mengadakan pesta untuk mereka. Sebelum mereka pulang kerumah,burung Gereja membawakan dua keranjang,yang satu sangat besar dan terlihat berat,dan yang lainnya kecil dan bersinar. Burung Gereja meminta mereka untuk memilih salah satu.<br />Mereka memilih yang kecil dan itu adalah pilihan yang terbaik. Terdapat banyak gulungan sutra dan tumpukan emas didalamnya.<br />Merasa iri,wanita tua pemarah melakukan hal yang sama dengan pria dan wanita yang baik. Ia memilih keranjang besar,yang sebenarnya berisi tawon (lebah penyengat) dan kalajengking yang berbisa,kelabang,dan makhluk mengerikan lainnya. Akhirnya,mereka menyengat dan menggigitnya hingga mati.<br /><br />

To show its gratitude, the sparrow stayed with them and sang every morning. But there was an ill-tempered old woman who didn't like the sparrow. She cut the sparrow's tongue. That's why the bird flew away to its previous nest.
Knowing that their sparrow flew away, the kind man and his wife looked for the sparrow. They walked a long way, crossed the bridges, climbed the mountains and passed the woods.
At last, they could find the sparrow's nest. The sparrow welcomed them and provided a feast for them. Before they went home, the sparrow brought two baskets; one was large and looked heavy, and the other one was small and light. The sparrow asked them to choose only one. They chose the small and that was the best choice. There were many rolls of silk and piles of gold in it.
Being jealous, the ill-tempered old woman did the same thing as the kind man and his wife did. She chose the big basket which actually contained wasps and venomous crawlers, such as scorpions, centipedes, and other horrible creatures. Finally, aaathey stung and bit her to death. </h2><br />
                        The Old Perempuan dan The Sparrow<br /><br />Sekali waktu, hiduplah seorang pria yang baik hati dan istrinya. Suatu pagi, istrinya menemukan burung gereja kecil miskin. Dia mengambil itu dengan lembut dan memberinya makan. Untuk menunjukkan rasa terima kasih yang, burung pipit tinggal dengan mereka dan bernyanyi setiap pagi. Tapi ada seorang wanita tua pemarah yang tidak suka pipit. Dia memotong lidah burung gereja itu. Itu sebabnya burung terbang ke sarangnya sebelumnya.<br /><br />Mengetahui bahwa burung gereja mereka terbang menjauh, orang baik dan istrinya mencari burung gereja tersebut. Mereka berjalan jauh, melintasi jembatan, naik gunung dan melewati hutan.<br /><br />Akhirnya, mereka bisa menemukan sarang burung gereja itu. Sparrow menyambut mereka dan memberikan pesta bagi mereka. Sebelum mereka pulang, burung pipit membawa dua keranjang; satu besar dan tampak berat, dan yang lain adalah kecil dan ringan. Sparrow meminta mereka untuk memilih hanya satu. Mereka memilih kecil dan itu adalah pilihan terbaik. Ada banyak gulungan sutra dan tumpukan emas di dalamnya.<br /><br />Cemburu, wanita tua pemarah melakukan hal yang sama seperti orang baik dan istrinya lakukan. Dia memilih keranjang besar yang benar-benar berisi tawon dan crawler berbisa, seperti kalajengking, kelabang, dan makhluk mengerikan lainnya. Akhirnya, aaathey menyengat dan menggigit sampai mati.<br />

                            27. Cerita The old woman and the goat past tenseTHE Old WOMAN AND GOAT</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>THE BLESSED GOAT</p><p>by Amy Friedman and Meredith Johnson</p><p>(a Russian tale)</p><p>December 15, 1996</p><p></p><p>Once upon a time a poor old man and woman owned a goat. They loved their goat as if he were a child, for they had no children of their own.</p><p></p><p>People talked about the old man and woman behind their backs. "Fools," they whispered, "treating a goat as if he were a son." "It's ridiculous," others said. "How can anyone love a goat?"</p><p></p><p>But the old man and woman did not care about gossip. They enjoyed their goat's company, and they treated him with tender affection.</p><p></p><p>One day the old man went into the forest to gather wood. As always, his goat trotted behind him. As he worked, the goat searched for bits of grass to munch among the fallen leaves.</p><p></p><p>When the old man had gathered all the wood he needed, he turned to call his goat. He noticed that the goat had dug a hole in the ground. The man looked into the hole, and at the bottom he saw an old, rusting trunk.</p><p></p><p>Without a moment's hesitation, he climbed into the hole. He got hold of the trunk and, breathing heavily, lifted it out of the hole.</p><p></p><p>Imagine his joy when he found inside hundreds of shining gold coins! He threw aside his wood, picked up the chest and hurried home. His faithful goat trotted closely behind him.</p><p></p><p>His wife was overjoyed at the sight of the gold. "This is our reward for all our hard years of work," she cried. "Now at last we shall live in comfort."</p><p></p><p>"My dear wife," the old man said, "we must not forget that this is our goat's fortune, for he is the one who found it. We will use it for his benefit." The old woman agreed, of course.</p><p></p><p>From that day on, the goat led a life of ease and comfort. Every morning the old man walked him to the farthest fields so that he might graze on the best grass. At night they laid him in a fleecy bed beside the fire.</p><p></p><p>For years the three lived very well and happily together. But, sad to say, one day the goat got sick, and before long he died.</p><p></p><p>"I shall dearly miss our goat," the old man said. "I will ask the priest to prepare a service for him." The old woman thought that a splendid idea.</p><p></p><p>The old man went to the church and bowed to the priest. "Father," he said humbly, "our old goat has died, and my wife and I want you to give him a fine funeral. He was very devout."</p><p></p><p>The priest was furious. "How dare you ask me to bury a useless old goat?" he cried.</p><p></p><p>But the old man was no fool. He looked into the priest's eyes and said, "Father, I forgot to say that our goat left you 200 rubles in his will."</p><p></p><p>"Ahh," said the priest. "Of course your goat deserves a funeral. I only wish you had explained which goat it was that died." And so the priest took the 200 rubles and sent the old man to the deacon to make preparations for the funeral.</p><p></p><p>"Good deacon," said the old man, "I want you to prepare a funeral."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, good man," said the deacon. "Tell me, who has died?"</p><p></p><p>"You never had the pleasure of meeting him, sir," said the old man, "but he was the finest goat in this whole land."</p><p></p><p>"How dare you tease me with foolish requests! Go away!" the deacon shouted.</p><p></p><p>"But deacon, my old goat was no ordinary creature. He was as devout as could be, and before he died he asked me to give you 100 rubles."</p><p></p><p>"Why did you not tell me which goat it was you meant?" exclimed the deacon. "Go quickly now and tell the bell ringer to ring the bells. We must all pray together for the good goat's soul."</p><p></p><p>The old man ran to the bell ringer. "Please ring the bells for my goat, who has died this very day."</p><p></p><p>"Off with you!" the bell ringer bellowed, losing his temper. "Do not treat me like a fool!"</p><p></p><p>"But sir," said the old man, "my goat was generous. He left you 50 rubles in his will."</p><p></p><p>"Oh," said the bell ringer. "I thought you meant another goat." And he seized the ropes and pulled with all his strength. Soon the whole village rang with the sound.</p><p></p><p>Not long afterward, the priest and the deacon appeared at the old man's house. Behind them came hundreds of people. In a long procession, they all walked to the graveyard. There the people placed the goat in a beautiful oak coffin and lowered it into a grave.</p><p></p><p>Several days later, the bishop came to town and heard the news of the goat's funeral. He called the priest, the deacon, the bell ringer and the old man. "How dare you grant a burial to a poor, shoddy goat!" he roared.</p><p></p><p>"But good sir," said the old man, "this goat left you 1,000 rubles for your goodness and generosity."</p><p></p><p>For a moment the bishop did not speak. Then he smiled and said: "Good sirs, please understand, I was not criticizing you for your burial. This goat was far too splendid for plain things. I only regret that you did not allow me to bless him with holy oil. Now I shall leave you with one thought, and one thought only: May the good goat rest in peace, forever and ever."</p><p></p><p>The old man walked home and told his wife of the bishop's blessing. Forever after, they always remembered their dear creature and all that he had given them. And no one ever called them fools again.</p><br />
